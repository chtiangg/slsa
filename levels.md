# Security levels

<div class="subtitle">

SLSA is organized into a series of levels that provide increasing supply chain
security guarantees. This gives you confidence that software hasn’t been
tampered with and can be securely traced back to its source.

</div>

This page is an informative overview of the SLSA levels, describing their
purpose and guarantees. For the normative requirements at each level, see
[Requirements](requirements.md). For a background, see
[Terminology](terminology.md).

## What is SLSA?

SLSA is a set of incrementally adoptable security guidelines, established by
industry consensus. The standards set by SLSA are guiding principles for both
software producers and consumers: producers can follow the guidelines to make
their software more secure, and consumers can make decisions based on a software
package's security posture. SLSA's levels are designed to be incremental
and actionable, and to protect against specific classes of supply chain attacks.
The highest level in each track represents an ideal end state, and the lower
levels represent intermediate milestones with commensurate security guarantees.

Importantly, SLSA is intended to be a primitive in a broader determination of a
software's risk. SLSA measures specific aspects of supply chain security,
particularly those that can be fully automated; other aspects, such as developer
trust and code quality, are out of scope. Furthermore, each link in the software
supply chain has its own, independent SLSA level ([FAQ](../faq.md)). The benefit
of this approach is to break up the large supply chain security problem into
tractable subproblems that can be prioritized based on risk and tackled in
parallel. But this does mean that SLSA alone is not sufficient to determine if
an artifact is "safe".

## Levels and tracks

SLSA levels are split into *tracks*. Each track has own set of levels that
measure a particular aspect of supply chain security. The purpose of tracks is
to recognize progress made in one aspect of security without blocking on an
unrelated aspect. Tracks also allow the SLSA spec to evolve: we can add more
tracks without invaliding previous levels.

| Track/Level | Requirements | Benefits |
| ----------- | ------------ | -------- |
| [Build L0]  | (none)       | (n/a)    |
| [Build L1]  | Attestation showing how the package was built | Documentation, inventorying |
| [Build L2]  | Signed attestation, generated by a hosted build service | Reduced attack surface, weak tamper protection |
| [Build L3]  | Hardened build service | Strong tamper protection |
| [Build L4]  | (not yet defined) | |
| [Source]    | (not yet defined) | |

> Note: The [previous version] of the specification used a single unnamed track,
> SLSA 1–4, roughly corresponding to the equivalently numbered Build + Source
> levels.

## Build track

The SLSA build track describes the level of protection against tampering
during or after the build, and the trustworthiness of provenance metadata.
Higher SLSA build levels provide increased confidence that a package truly came
from the correct sources, without unauthorized modification or influence.

> **TODO:** Add a diagram visualizing the following.

Summary of the build track:

-   Generate a **provenance attestation** automatically during each build.
-   Build on **hardened services** that have been manually audited.

Exactly how this is implemented is up to the packaging ecosystem (for open
source) or organization (for closed source), including: what provenance format
is accepted, whether reproducible builds are used, and how provenance is
distributed. Guidelines for implementers can be found in the
[requirements](requirements.md).

<section id="build-l0">

### Build L0: No guarantees

<dl class="as-table">
<dt>Summary<dd>

No requirements---L0 represents the lack of SLSA.

<dt>Intended for<dd>

Software that does not need SLSA, such as:

-   Binaries built and executed on the same machine, including continuous
    integration tests.
-   Software that is never distributed to customers or used in environments with
    sensitive access.

<dt>Requirements<dd>

n/a

<dt>Benefits<dd>

<section id="build-l1">

### Build L1: Provenance

<dl class="as-table">
<dt>Summary<dd>

Package has a provenance attestation showing how it was built, though without
tamper protection.

<dt>Intended for<dd>

Projects and organizations wanting to easily and quickly gain some benefits of
SLSA other than tamper protection, while waiting to achieve higher levels.

<dt>Requirements<dd>

-   Up front, the package maintainer defines some sort of "build script" that
    automates how the package is supposed to be built.

-   On each build, the release process automatically generates and distributes a
    [provenance attestation] describing how the artifact was *actually* built,
    including: who built the package (person or system), what process/command
    was used, and what the input artifacts were.

<dt>Benefits<dd>

For consumers:

-   Allows the consumer to known what the exact source code was for a given
    artifact so that they can audit it or make decisions based on it.
-   Makes it easier for consumers to build the software themselves, by knowing
    what the official process and sources were.

For large organizations and enterprises:

-   Aids in creating an inventory of first-party software and build systems
    across many teams.
-   Provides audit trail to narrow the scope of incident investigations.

<dt>Notes<dd>

-   Provenance may be incomplete and/or unsigned at L1. Higher levels require
    more complete and trustworthy provenance.

<section id="build-l2">

### Build L2: Build service

<dl class="as-table">
<dt>Summary<dd>

Builds run on a hosted service that generates and signs the provenance, reducing
attack surface and offering some tamper protection.

<dt>Intended for<dd>

Projects and organizations waiting for their build service to implement Build L3.

<dt>Requirements<dd>

All of [Build L1], plus:

-   Builds run on a hosted build service that generates and signs the
    provenance itself, outside the control of the users of the build service.

<dt>Benefits<dd>

For package maintainers:

-   Prevents tampering of the artifact after the build.
-   In some cases, reduces impact of compromised package upload credentials.

For consumers:

-   Strongly identifies what build service was used.

For large organizations and enterprises:

-   Allows large-scale migration of teams to supported build services early
    while further hardening work ([Build L3]) is done in parallel.

</dl>
</section>
<section id="build-l3">

### Build L3: Hardened builds

<dl class="as-table">
<dt>Summary<dd>

Builds run on a hardened build service that offers strong tamper protection.

<dt>Intended for<dd>

Most software releases.

<dt>Requirements<dd>

All of [Build L2], plus:

-   Build service implements strong controls to prevent runs from influencing
    one another, even within the same project.

> **TODO:** Add requirement about survey and audit as per the v1.0 proposal.

<dt>Benefits<dd>

For package maintainers:

-   Prevents tampering of the artifact during or after the build.
-   Reduces impact of compromised upload credentials.

For consumers:

-   Greatly increases confidence that the package was built from the declared
    source.

For large organizations and enterprises:

-   Reduces risk that a compromised credential or rogue maintainer bypassed the
    official change management system.

### Build L4: (not yet defined)

Build L4 is not yet defined. For reference, [previous version] of SLSA defined a
"SLSA 4" that included the following requirements, which *may or may not* be
part of a future Build L4:

-   Pinned dependencies, which guarantee that each build runs on exactly the
    same set of inputs.
-   Hermetic builds, which guarantee that no extraneous dependencies are used.
-   All dependencies listed in the provenance, which enables downstream systems
    to recursively apply SLSA to dependencies.
-   Reproducible builds, which enable other systems to corroborate the
    provenance.

</section>
<section id="source-track">

## Source track (not yet defined)

The Source track is not yet defined but is expected to measure protection
against tampering of the source code. It will be defined in a future version of
the specification.

For reference, the [previous version] of SLSA included the following
requirements, which *may or may not* be part of a future Source track:

-   Strong authentication of author and reviewer identities to resist account
    and credential compromise, such as 2-factor authentication using a hardware
    security key.
-   Retention of the source code to allow for after-the-fact inspection and
    future rebuilds.
-   Mandatory two-person review of all changes to the source to prevent a single
    compromised actor or account from introducing malicious changes.
